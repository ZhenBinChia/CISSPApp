            ],
            "correct_option": "Security awareness training",
            "explanation": "Security controls are categorized into three main types: technical, physical, and administrative. Technical controls include firewalls, encryption, and access controls, while physical controls include locks, security cameras, and barriers. Administrative controls involve policies, procedures, and training programs designed to enforce security. Security awareness training educates employees on cybersecurity best practices, reducing the likelihood of human error leading to security breaches. This is crucial because most security incidents originate from phishing, social engineering, or poor security hygiene."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)",
            "explanation": "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used access control model where permissions are assigned based on a user's role within an organization rather than individual user discretion. This simplifies access management, enhances security, and ensures compliance with organizational policies. For example, a 'Finance Manager' role may have access to payroll systems, whereas an 'IT Administrator' may have system configuration privileges. Unlike Discretionary Access Control (DAC), where users have control over resource permissions, RBAC ensures that access is centrally managed based on job function."

            ],
            "correct_option": "To identify, assess, and mitigate risks",
            "explanation": "Risk management in cybersecurity focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks rather than eliminating them completely, as absolute security is unachievable. Organizations use risk management frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS to determine acceptable risk levels, prioritize threats, and allocate resources accordingly. Risk mitigation strategies include implementing security controls, transferring risks through insurance, accepting minor risks, or avoiding high-risk activities altogether. Without a structured risk management approach, organizations may overspend on unnecessary security controls or fail to address critical vulnerabilities."

                "Preparation"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Preparation",
            "explanation": "The incident response lifecycle, as outlined by NIST (SP 800-61), consists of six stages: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Activities. The Preparation phase is the most crucial, as it involves developing an incident response plan, setting up communication channels, training personnel, and ensuring proper monitoring tools are in place. Without adequate preparation, organizations may struggle to detect, contain, and mitigate cyber incidents effectively, leading to prolonged downtime and greater financial losses."

                "Salting"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Asymmetric encryption",
            "explanation": "Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This differs from symmetric encryption, which uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption is widely used in secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS, digital signatures, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). For example, in HTTPS communication, a web server provides its public key to clients, allowing them to encrypt messages that only the server's private key can decrypt, ensuring secure data transmission."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the purpose of a firewall in network security?",
            "options": [
                "To encrypt data transmissions",
                "To detect malware on endpoints",
                "To filter incoming and outgoing network traffic",
                "To perform vulnerability scans on systems"
            ],
            "correct_option": "To filter incoming and outgoing network traffic",
            "explanation": "A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or cloud-based and play a critical role in preventing unauthorized access to private networks. They can block malicious IP addresses, restrict access to certain ports, and enforce security policies. While firewalls enhance security, they are not designed to detect malware or perform vulnerability scans; these tasks are handled by intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and vulnerability management tools."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following best describes an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?",
            "options": [
                "A type of malware that spreads automatically",
                "An attack where hackers gain unauthorized access and remain undetected for a long period",
                "A denial-of-service attack on a network",
                "An accidental data breach caused by human error"
            ],
            "correct_option": "An attack where hackers gain unauthorized access and remain undetected for a long period",
            "explanation": "An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) refers to a long-term, targeted cyberattack where adversaries gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for extended periods. APTs are often backed by nation-states or organized cybercriminal groups and use sophisticated tactics such as zero-day exploits, credential theft, and lateral movement. Their goal is to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or gain strategic advantages. Unlike traditional malware, APTs focus on persistence, stealth, and gradual data exfiltration, making them challenging to detect and mitigate."
        },       {
            "question": "Which of the following principles ensures that users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions?",
            "options": [
                "Separation of Duties",
                "Defense in Depth",
                "Least Privilege",
                "Need to Know"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Least Privilege",
            "explanation": "The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) ensures that users and processes are granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of privileges. Unlike 'Need to Know,' which focuses on restricting access to sensitive information, Least Privilege applies to system-level permissions, including file access, system configurations, and network operations. Implementing this principle helps prevent privilege escalation attacks and limits the impact of potential security breaches."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following authentication methods is considered the most secure?",
            "options": [
                "Username and password",
                "Biometric authentication",

                "Single sign-on (SSO)"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Two-factor authentication (2FA)",
            "explanation": "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) improves security by requiring two distinct forms of authentication: something you know (password), something you have (security token, mobile device), or something you are (biometrics). While biometric authentication is strong, it can be compromised if biometric data is stolen. Single Sign-On (SSO) improves convenience but introduces a single point of failure if compromised. Username and password authentication alone is the weakest due to password reuse and phishing risks."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a qualitative risk assessment metric?",
            "options": [
                "Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)",
                "Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)",
                "High/Medium/Low risk categorization",
                "Exposure Factor (EF)"
            ],
            "correct_option": "High/Medium/Low risk categorization",
            "explanation": "Qualitative risk assessments use subjective measures such as High/Medium/Low risk levels to evaluate threats. These assessments rely on expert judgment and experience rather than numerical data. In contrast, Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), and Exposure Factor (EF) are part of quantitative risk assessment, which uses mathematical calculations to determine financial impact and risk probability."
        },
        {
            "question": "During an incident, which step focuses on containing the impact and preventing further damage?",
            "options": [
                "Preparation",
                "Containment",
                "Eradication",
                "Post-Incident Review"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Containment",
            "explanation": "The Containment phase in incident response is critical for stopping the spread of an attack or breach. This may involve isolating affected systems, disabling compromised user accounts, or blocking malicious network traffic. Containment is followed by the Eradication phase, which removes the root cause of the incident, such as malware or unauthorized access. The Preparation phase ensures readiness before incidents occur, and Post-Incident Review helps improve future responses."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following cryptographic techniques is used to ensure data integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Encryption",
                "Hashing",

                "Digital signatures"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Hashing",
            "explanation": "Hashing is a cryptographic process that converts input data into a fixed-length output (hash value), ensuring data integrity. Hash functions like SHA-256 and MD5 create unique outputs, and even small changes in input data produce vastly different hash values. While encryption ensures confidentiality and digital signatures verify authenticity, hashing is specifically used for data integrity by detecting unauthorized modifications."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a network security best practice to reduce attack surfaces?",
            "options": [
                "Disabling unused network services and ports",
                "Allowing all outbound traffic by default",
                "Using static IP addresses for all devices",
                "Implementing a flat network architecture"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Disabling unused network services and ports",
            "explanation": "Reducing the attack surface involves minimizing exposure to potential security threats. One of the best practices is disabling unused network services and ports to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. Allowing all outbound traffic increases risks, and static IP addresses do not directly improve security. A flat network lacks segmentation, making it easier for attackers to move laterally within a compromised network."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a common attack used to gain unauthorized access to web applications?",
            "options": [
                "SQL Injection",
                "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)",
                "Denial-of-Service (DoS)",
                "Brute force attack"
            ],
            "correct_option": "SQL Injection",
            "explanation": "SQL Injection (SQLi) is a common web application attack where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate or access backend databases. This can lead to data leaks, unauthorized access, or database corruption. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks involve intercepting network communication, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks overload systems, and Brute Force attacks attempt to guess login credentials."
        },        {
            "question": "What security principle helps ensure that a single individual does not have complete control over a critical security function?",
            "options": [
                "Need to Know",
                "Separation of Duties",
                "Defense in Depth",
                "Least Privilege"
            ],
            "correct_option": "Separation of Duties",
            "explanation": "Separation of Duties (SoD) ensures that critical security functions are divided among multiple individuals to reduce the risk of fraud, insider threats, and errors. For example, in financial transactions, one employee might be responsible for authorizing payments, while another processes them. This prevents a single person from carrying out unauthorized actions without oversight."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a zero-day vulnerability?",
            "options": [
                "A security flaw that has been publicly disclosed but not yet patched",
                "A vulnerability that has existed for more than a year",
                "A system weakness that can only be exploited by insiders",
                "A software bug that affects zero users"
            ],
            "correct_option": "A security flaw that has been publicly disclosed but not yet patched",
            "explanation": "A zero-day vulnerability is a previously unknown security flaw that attackers exploit before a patch or fix is available. These vulnerabilities are dangerous because there are no existing defenses against them at the time of discovery. Organizations must rely on security measures like behavior-based detection, intrusion prevention systems, and timely patch management to mitigate zero-day threats."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Using the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)",
            "explanation": "Privilege escalation attacks occur when an attacker gains higher-level access than they should have. The best way to mitigate this risk is by applying the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), ensuring that users, applications, and processes only have the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks. This limits the potential impact of compromised accounts."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Ransomware",
            "explanation": "Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files or locks access to a system, demanding payment (often in cryptocurrency) in exchange for decryption. Modern ransomware strains also exfiltrate data, threatening to leak it if the ransom isn't paid. Preventing ransomware involves regular backups, endpoint protection, and strong email security measures."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Network Access Control (NAC)",
            "explanation": "Network Access Control (NAC) enhances security by verifying device identity, security posture, and compliance status before granting access to a network. NAC solutions enforce security policies, ensuring that only compliant devices (e.g., those with updated antivirus software) can connect. This helps prevent unauthorized access, especially in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environments."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Provides real-time security event monitoring and correlation",
            "explanation": "A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system collects, analyzes, and correlates security event logs from multiple sources (firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoints, etc.) in real-time. This helps detect threats, identify suspicious patterns, and support compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA). SIEM solutions play a vital role in incident response and forensic investigations."

            ],
            "correct_option": "Both the cloud provider and the customer are responsible for security",
            "explanation": "In the shared responsibility model, cloud security is a joint effort between the cloud provider and the customer. The provider secures the infrastructure (e.g., data centers, physical security), while customers are responsible for securing data, applications, and configurations (e.g., access controls, encryption). Misconfigurations by customers remain a top cloud security risk."

            "correct_option": "To prevent malicious activity by blocking attacks in real-time",
            "explanation": "An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively monitors network traffic for malicious activity and takes automated actions, such as blocking or dropping packets that match known attack signatures. IPS works alongside Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which only alert administrators but do not take active measures to block threats. IPS is a key component in Defense in Depth strategies to protect against cyberattacks."

            "correct_option": "Brute-force attack",
            "explanation": "Brute-force attacks occur when an attacker systematically tries every possible password combination until access is granted. Weak password policies (e.g., short passwords, lack of complexity) make systems more vulnerable to these attacks. Organizations can mitigate brute-force attacks by enforcing strong password policies, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and using account lockout mechanisms."

France, Italy, and Germany, as EU member states, are all bound by those principles. The United States does not have a comprehensive privacy law codifying those principles, so the onward transfer requirement applies."

The resort\u2019s main data center is located in northern Indiana in an area that is prone to tornados. Henry recently undertook a replacement cost analysis and determined that rebuilding and reconfiguring the data center would cost $10 million. Henry consulted with tornado experts, data center specialists, and structural engineers. Together, they determined that a typical tornado would cause approximately $5 million of damage to the facility. The meteorologists determined that Atwood\u2019s facility lies in an area where they are likely to experience a tornado once every 200 years.   Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the annualized rate of occurrence for a tornado at Atwood Landing\u2019s data center?",

Making passwords longer can greatly increase the size of the rainbow table required to find the matching hash, and adding a salt to the password will make it nearly impossible for the attacker to generate a table that will match unless they can acquire the salt value. MD5 and SHA1 are both poor choices for password hashing compared to modern password hashes, which are designed to make hashing easy and recovery difficult. Rainbow tables are often used against lists of hashes acquired by attacks rather than over-the-wire attacks, so over-the-wire encryption is not particularly useful here. Shadow passwords simply make the traditionally worldreadable list of password hashes on Unix and Linux systems available in a location readable only by root. This doesn\u2019t prevent a rainbow table attack once the hashes are obtained."

Normally, the HTTPOnly attribute is a good idea, but it prevents scripting rather than requiring unencrypted HTTP sessions."
